Hello and welcome to my project based on the Filipino flag

## **Template VGA Design**
### **Project Set-Up**
Summarise the project set-up and design flow. Include a screenshot of your own set-up, for example see the image of my Project Summary window below. Guideline 1 short paragraph.

### **Template Code**

The template I was given, simulated the VGA interface which works by sending analog signals of RGB and timing signals to paint the screen with various colours. This works by using binary coding, precision / timing, HSync and VSync pulses. 
With VGATop as the head design source, the clock, VGASync and the ColourStripes are sub headings.

### **Simulation**
Explain the simulation process. Reference any important details, include a well-selected screenshot of the simulation. Guideline: 1/2 short paragraphs.

### **Synthesis**
Describe the synthesis and implementation processes. Consider including 1/2 useful screenshot(s). Guideline: 1/2 short paragraphs.

### **Demonstration**
Perhaps add a picture of your demo. Guideline: 1/2 sentences.

## **My VGA Design Edit**
Introduce your own design idea. Consider how complex/achievabble this might be or otherwise. Reference any research you do online (use hyperlinks).

### **Code Adaptation**
Briefly show how you changed the template code to display a different image. Demonstrate your understanding. Guideline: 1-2 short paragraphs.

### **Simulation**
Show how you simulated your own design. Are there any things to note? Demonstrate your understanding. Add a screenshot. Guideline: 1-2 short paragraphs.

### **Synthesis**
Describe the synthesis & implementation outputs for your design, are there any differences to that of the original design? Guideline 1-2 short paragraphs.

### **Demonstration**
If you get your own design working on the Basys3 board, take a picture! Guideline: 1-2 sentences.

## **More Markdown Basics**
This is a paragraph. Add an empty line to start a new paragraph.

Font can be emphasised as *Italic* or **Bold**.

Code can be highlighted by using `backticks`.

Hyperlinks look like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list can be rendered as follows:
- vectors
- algorithms
- iterators

Images can be added by uploading them to the repository in a /docs/assets/images folder, and then rendering using HTML via githubusercontent.com as shown in the example below.
